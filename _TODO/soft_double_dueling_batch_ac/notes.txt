This is a basically minimal implementation of ddpg.
It does not contain:
    1. initialization.
    2. noise

Perhaps a better description would be... 
Soft Double Dueling Batch Actor Critic.

Which without the frills, is what DDPG is.
However ddpg has a different actor loss. 
Where in ac the actor pushes its action probabilities towards a
nearsighted increasing reward (as nearsighted as the critics value predictions),
DDPG pushes its actor parameters towards maximizing greedily selected 
action advantage values. These are fundamentally different. 
I suspect DDPG is inherently more greedy with this loss function, 
but can more easily differentiate between actions with similar results 
in the same state. (much like dueling... unsurprisingly. bc dueling 
focuses on the action advantage stream) ((list cases where dueling is worse due to this.))
