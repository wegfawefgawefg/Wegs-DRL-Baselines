1.  double actor critic

2.  long term short term actor critic
    2 actors. one that uses old knowledge, one that learns online.

    the old knowledge one has aggressive td clipping, but can work from a replay buffer.
    the new actor learns online
    the policy is a sum of both actors voting in, weighted by some number on each

    with world model can support lookahead.
        that is to say you can see what would happen with just old actor or just new actor
