test world model

world model being used in place of next state means at best the agent can do as well as the non world modeling one...
because next_state is noiseless. WM(state) is noiseful. 
so to get benefits from the world model, you have to use the world model for something other than 1-step next state prediction.

naive limited ideas:
a. perhaps for 2-step?

1. the world model needs to share feature space with the actor, or critic, 
2. the world model can be used for nstep in cases where the env is not settable
3. the world model can be used to detect divergence points
4. the world model can be used to predict far ahead.
5. the world model is part of the reward structure. 
6. the world model is used to predict the specific world result of an action.
7. the world model is used to simulate past detected divergences.
8. the world model is used to establish a visual goal for the agent, 
    by fixing the farthest prediction.
    and making the error between the actual prediction and the target.
9. the world model is used to create a searchable decision tree
10. the world model is used to predict results of other agents in the space? (probably over anthropomorphization)
11. trajectory refinement
